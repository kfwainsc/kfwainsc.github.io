        <p>
          My background includes two and a half years of Computer Science classes as well as a
          previous career in Fine Arts along with a BFA.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have completed the full list of prerequisite classes and have been admitted into the CS
          Post Baccalaureate Master's program at Portland State University. However, at this point
          the program does not match up with my career goals, so I am continuing to take courses and
          complete certificate programs on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a strong background in C++ and Python with over two years of programing in them,
          with a strong emphasis on OOP. I am very comfortable working in Linux and Windows command
          line environments but am well versed in IDEs such as VS Code as well. My formal training
          as an artist has cultivated an intense attention to detail along with a strong ability to
          think creatively in order to solve difficult problems. These qualities, along with a
          history of being a self-starter and an equal ability to work in teams will translate well
          into the software industry to create projects that not only will fulfill but exceed the
          clients' expectations and needs.
