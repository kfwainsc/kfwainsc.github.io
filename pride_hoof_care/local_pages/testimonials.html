              Eli has been shoeing my two minis for over three years now. Their feet are amazingly
              improved and it is always a pleasure to talk with Eli. My cousin now has Eli doing his
              three drafts as well and is equally impressed. Ten out of ten would recomended!

              My 20-year-old Welsh pony named Rocky needed some hoof love! He had a history of
              founder in the past and struggled with foot issues. He needed consistent and specific
              care for his feet. Our family looked for someone that could come out on a regular
              schedule and do a great job with our favorite furry friend. Eli took on the challenge
              and has done a fantastic job of keeping Rocky on his feet. Despite his age he's been
              able to keep up with two young, very active girls that love him a ton! Thank you Eli!

              Both me and my horses have been so happy with Eli as our farrier. I would and have
              recomended them to anyone in need of excellent hoofcare.

              It took me a long time to find someone who understood how to deal with difficult feet,
              but I've been very happy with every job that Eli has ever done for me.
